### What is this repository for? ###

The task at hand is the development of a collaborative platform for archival and sharing of student coursework.  
The platform should allow handling of:  * Groups of two/three students;  
* A repository of documents;  
* Appropriate redundancy measures, against data loss;  
* Consistency checks;  
* Optional: a versioning strategy.
