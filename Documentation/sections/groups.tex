\section{Groups Guide} \label{s:platform-user-guide:groups} 
	Groups similarly to projects have one owner. User can create a group from the left expander as shown in Figure \ref{fig:creating-group-view}. After clicking on the \emph{New Group} button user will be redirected to the view where he/she would be able to specify name, description and visibility of the group -- Figure \ref{fig:group-settings-view}. After creating the group user can add members with chosen permission similarly to the project -- Figure \ref{fig:adding-user-to-group} or add project as shown in Figure \ref{fig:adding-project-to-group}. Creating projects for the group looks exactly the same and is described in Section \ref{s:platform-user-guide:projects}.
