\section{Administrations guide} \label{s:platform-user-guide:administrations}
	\gls{gitlab} contains a lot of administration features that are described deeply in \cite{bib:gitlabce-documentation-overview}. One of the most interesting features is overview panel (Figure \ref{fig:administration-overview-view}) from which we can find information about latest projects, users, groups, statistics, features and components. Following three Figures \ref{fig:user-administration-view}, \ref{fig:groups-administration-view} and \ref{fig:projects-administration-view} presents administration panel which have functionality to add/delete/modify or temporary lock respectively users, groups and projects. The last worth mentioning view shows how hardware resources are used by application -- Figure \ref{fig:resource-usage-view}. This view shows the \emph{CPU}, memory and disks usage.
