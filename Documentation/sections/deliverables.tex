\section{Platform requirements} \label{s:introduction:platform-requirements}
	The task is development of a collaborative platform for archival and sharing of student coursework. The platform should allow handling of:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Groups of two/three students;
		\item A repository of documents;
		\item Appropriate redundance measures, against data loss;
		\item Consistency checks;
		\item Optional: a versioning strategy.
	\end{itemize}
	The documents may be stored in source format (\LaTeX, docx) or in PDF.
